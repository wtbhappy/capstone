# capstone
I have created 4 notebooks 
1. capstone_data for processing initial data (100% completed)
- data for hdb flat resale transactions from 2015 to 2020 collected
- data for macroeconomic factors, supply and demand collected
- data for points of interest collected
- fetched all necessary geocodes

2. capstone_eda for visualization
- plotted for macroecnomic factors
- more visualizations to be added

3. capstone_feature_engineering
- added macroeconomic factors as features (completed)
- added distances from points of interest as features (completed)

4. capstone_modeling for modeling
- facing some problem with the keras due to tensorflow (moving to colab to try out)


Outstanding Issues
- keras/tensorflow problem (moving to colab to try out)
- unable to upload the combined datasets to github due to file size limitation
