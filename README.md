# capstone
A. Notebooks

I have created 4 notebooks 
1. capstone_data for processing initial data (100% completed)
- data for hdb flat resale transactions from 2015 to 2020 collected
- data for macroeconomic factors, supply and demand collected
- data for points of interest collected
- fetched all necessary geocodes

2. capstone_eda for visualization
- plotted for macroecnomic factors
- more visualizations to be added

3. capstone_feature_engineering
- added macroeconomic factors as features (completed)
- added distances from points of interest as features (completed)

The dataset has 89 columns

4. capstone_modeling for modeling
- facing some problems with the keras due to tensorflow (moving to colab to try out)


B. File Directories for datasets
1. datasets/input
- raw data files

2. datasets/output folder
- for processed data files after cleaning

3. datasets/final
- for datasets with features added
- due to github's file size limitation the combined file has been uploaded in zip format

C. Outstanding Issues
- keras/tensorflow problem (moving to colab to try out)
