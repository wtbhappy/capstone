"Data are for mid-year.  As the income data are captured from a sample survey, the income changes for the 20th percentile nearer the end of the income spectrum tend to be more volatile over shorter (e.g. year-on-year) than longer periods (e.g. 5 or 10 years).  Gross monthly income from work refers to income earned from employment.  For employees, it refers to the gross monthly wages or salaries before deduction of employee CPF contributions and personal income tax.  It comprises basic wages, overtime pay, commissions, tips, other allowances and one-twelfth of annual bonuses.  For self-employed persons, gross monthly income refers to the average monthly profits from their business, trade or profession (i.e. total receipts less business expenses incurred) before deduction of income tax.  Data exclude full-time national servicemen.  Residents refer to Singapore citizens and permanent residents.  Before 2009, full-time employment refers to employment where the normal hours of work is 30 hours or more in a week.  From 2009 onwards, full-time employment refers to employment where the normal hours of work is 35 hours or more in a week.  Data for 2000 and 2005 are not available as the comprehensive Labour Force Survey was not conducted in these years due to the conduct of the Census and General Household Survey by Department of Statistics, Ministry of Trade and Industry.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
